    %% this is rambling below
    % we should take the timings from the bottom of the list. and then use them
    % The manually specified slicetiming file needs to be a text file that 
    % specifies the timing (in seconds) of every slice relative to the start of 
    % the volume acquisition (t=0). The file must have one number per slice and be 
    % arranged in one line, separated by spaces, and each number is the timing value 
    % for that slice (e.g. third number gives the timing of the third slice,
    % where numbering of slices is consistent with the NIFTI voxel coordinate;
    % i.e. the way that FSLView/FSLeyes shows them).

    % first time of first slice of first volume subtracted 
    % from time of start of the first slice of next volume = 880 tics
    % which sampled at 400 Hz is 2.2 seconds.
    % so I can find the points in the physio that match up with this.
    % at 100 Hz I can match the triggers for the starts of the first slices and match these up
